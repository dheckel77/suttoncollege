# Sutton College
This is a website that was build from an HTML file and brought over into WordPress. 

The site is built out using custom post types for campus locations, professors, courses, and events. Advanced Custom Fields was also used to flesh out the custom fields for all of the post types.

It also uses custom REST API queries to pull data from the custom post types.

There is also a section that utilizes Ajax database updates for the Professor like button.
